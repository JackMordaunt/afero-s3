Provide afero filesystem with [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) as backend.

## Thanks

These codes allowed me to bootstrap the development but you should NOT use them, they are completely broken.

This is a fork from [wreulicke's fork](https://github.com/wreulicke/afero-s3)
Itself forked from [aviau's fork](https://github.com/aviau/).
This originally implemented by [rgarcia](https://github.com/rgarcia) and updated by [aviau](https://github.com/aviau).
